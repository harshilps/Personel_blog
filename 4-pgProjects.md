      Personality Based Recommender System</a><br>
      It uses machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to identify your personality from your social media handles and recommend people based on your personality.
      Using user’s data from their social media accounts it creates a personality vector using “The Big Five Personality” model.
      Trained the classifier using SVM(Support Vector Machine) with 82% accuracy and cosine similarity to find the perfect match.
      To find users having similar profiles compared the different vectors using the cosine similarly matrix. 
      Also carried out testing using Mocha Test Cases and JMeter tool.<br><span>[<a href="https://github.com/harshilps/Personality-based-recommender-system">code</a>]</span>
