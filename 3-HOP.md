      Final Year Project: Automatic Plant Watering System</a><br>
      The goal of this project was to make a product which will be useful in day to day life and which will make peoples life easy and it will mainly help farmers to produce more crop and also to universities and nursery.
      Moisturizing sensor is a device which senses moisture and works accordingly. We will build a model which will sense the moisture. A moisture sensor is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of moisture in plants by sensing we can help make the life of people easy in day to day life and they will have to do less work. 
  
    Programming Language used to make Arduino and Sensors communicate between each other is Lua.

      Computer Graphics: A simple 3 lane car racing game. </a><br>
      Developed a simple car racing game in C using the basics of Computer Graphics. The player gets 3 life to progress through levels and complete the whole track. The speed increases while progressing through each level by minimizing the delay of a car reappearing. A simple twist has also been included by adding a story to this simple game.
