      Final Year Project: Automatic Plant Watering System</a><br>
      The goal of this project was to make a product which will be useful in day to day life and which will make peoples life easy and it will mainly help farmers to produce more crop and also to universities and nursery.
      Moisturizing sensor is a device which senses moisture and works accordingly. We will build a model which will sense the moisture. A moisture sensor is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of moisture in plants by sensing we can help make the life of people easy in day to day life and they will have to do less work. 
  
    Programming Language used to make Arduino and Sensors communicate between each other is Lua.
