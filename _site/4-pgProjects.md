      LinkedIn Prototype using MERN Stack</a><br>
      Deployed a LinkedIn Prototype using MERN Stack on Amazon Web Services(AWS) carried as an Enterprise Distributed Systems project. It uses Kafka as message queues and for publish/subscribe architechture. Along with MongoDB, it also uses MySQL database for data which requires high security. It keeps in mind the enterprise wide use and thus the architechture with thich the application has been developed and hosted supports Availability and Partitioning. For faster responses, it also uses Redis caching of both the databases' data. 
      Also carried out testing using Mocha Test Cases and JMeter tool.<br><i>Nov 2018</i>.<br><span>[<a href="https://github.com/darshilpk3/LinkedIn-Prototype-using-MERN-Stack">code</a>]</span>

      Statistical Analysis of Hospital Data using MPC</a><br>
      With the increasing competition and the need to apply machine learning to data to get useful insights is also increasing. This project gives a proof of concept to use Multi Party Computation(MPC) in the real world to apply data mining algorithms on data which requires high security. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">Click here</a> to know more about Multi Party Computation.
      This project forecasts the expected number of patients of each hospital taking part in the computation using ARIMA Model. It has python flask's backend and React frontend to communicate with the backend. It uses mongoDB as database. <br><i>Nov 2018</i>.<br><span>[<a href="https://github.com/darshilpk3/Statistical-Analysis-of-Hospital-Data-using-MPC">code</a>]</span>

      HomeAway Prototype using MERN Stack</a><br>
      Deployed a HomeAway Prototype using MERN Stack on Amazon Web Services(AWS). It also uses Kafka as message queues and for publish/subscribe architechture and Redux for state management. It keeps in mind the enterprise wide use and thus the architechture with thich the application has been developed and hosted supports Availability and Partitioning. Used PassportJS and JWT Tokens for authentication.<br><i>Aug 2018</i>.<br><span>[<a href="https://github.com/darshilpk3/HomeAway-Prototype-using-MERN-Stack">code</a>]</span>
