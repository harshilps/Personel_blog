				src="/assets/img/profile.jpg"> I am a Master's student at Santa Clara University,
			studying Computer Science and Engineering. I will be graduating in the June of 2019 and currently seeking 
			Full-time or internship opportunity in the related field where I can enhance the knowledge of technologies
			and put to practice whatever I have learnt during my graduate studies</p>
		<p> Talking about this field, since the invention of mobile phones and portable desktops, I was quite intrigued
			by what these small machines could do to help us in our day to day life, especially those Smart Voice 
			Assistants which are getting smarter day by day since 2008. This motivated me to choose this field for my
			further education as I wanted to contribute to the growth of this field. With this motivation, I started 
			my journey with Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering and now continuing the journey with Master's 
			degree in Computer Science and Engineering to achieve what I initially strived for.</p>
			<p>I am especially proud of my Senior Year Project which was titled: “Home on Phone: Adding Value to Your
			Home”.
			In this IOT based project, the key challenge was to design smart products that could improve the quality of
			our daily life and
			make our homes smarter. The icing on the cake for me was when we won the First Prize for our efforts in the
			prestigious Projects Showcase Competition held by the Computer Society of India – an achievement that makes
			me proud till this day.</p>
			<p>In addition to my academic endeavors I have always strived to gain practical knowledge whenever possible. A
			case in point is my four months internship at the SSM Infotech Company between May-August 2016. As
			the leader of the four-person team that worked on this project I learnt how to organize and delegate
			responsibilities effectively among my team members as per their individual capabilities and more importantly
			how to work and lead the team seamlessly as part of a team. This internship also gave me an opportunity to
			learn new tools like Node.JS in addition to enhancing my working knowledge.
			With these projects and experiences, that I have had throughout my journey, hold me in good stead to
			contribute even more to this field and learning along with it. </p>
		<p> Fast Forwarding, now being a master's student I have done many projects like Yelp Faceted Search and 
			Personality based Recommender System to extend my knowledge even further. There are many more projects that I have
			done. For full portfolio, reports and code follow the Projects tab above. </p>
		<p>I am particularly interested in Exploring more towards this Full Stack Development by integrating it with
			Data Science, since the power of Data Science is something we all know about and has been talked about at
			various places. For full profile check out my linkedIn at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshilps/">Harshil Shah</a>.
