I am currently enrolled in <a href="http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/catalog/courses/CMPE275.html">Enterprise Application Development</a> under Prof. Charles Zhang. I will be working on spring framework to develop enterprise wide application as a project for the course. I will be deciding on the application to be used as a prototype.
